MediWaste Box - Medical Equipment Detection Android App
MediWaste Box is an Android mobile application that utilizes machine learning to detect and classify medical equipment. The app is built using the TensorFlow Object Detection API and trained on the SSD MobileNet v1 model. With a dataset of 10,000 scraped and manually labeled images from the Internet, MediWaste Box offers accurate and reliable identification of medical equipment.

Features
Medical Equipment Detection: The app employs a trained machine learning model to detect various types of medical equipment in real-time.

Fast and Efficient: The SSD MobileNet v1 model ensures quick and efficient detection, providing near-instant results.

User-Friendly Interface: MediWaste Box features a simple and intuitive user interface, allowing users to easily capture images and receive instant feedback on the detected medical equipment.
